This project explores the At-Risk/ Expiring Affordable Housing Inventory in the City of Los Angeles. The inventory was prepared
for the [Housing Element to the General Plan](https://planning.lacity.org/HousingInitiatives/HousingElement/TOCHousingElement.htm).
The description for this inventory and the contents are as follows:

> The City currently has 19,888 housing units at risk of losing their affordability
> use restrictions between October 1, 2013 and September, 30 2023. These
> units were designated as at-risk based on the restrictions established by
> the primary government funding program used to build or rehabilitate the
> unit, use agreement, covenant and/or rental subsidy program. This primary
> funding source is interpreted as the most restrictive source of funding in the
> rental covenant, rental subsidy or funding; it is the source with the most years
> of affordability and set-aside units. Appendix B provides a summary of the
> at-risk/expiring properties. Appendix C provides a detailed inventory of the
> at-risk/expiring properties during this Housing Element Update period. - Chapter 1, item 7 of the Housing Element

A PDF has been made for this inventory and this repo contains a CSV of locations scapped from this document for geocoding.
A Shapefile was made locating housing from 2017-2021 and is in this repo.
